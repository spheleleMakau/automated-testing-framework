# Automated Testing Framework

## Overview

The Automated Testing Framework is a Python-based testing tool designed to automate the testing of web applications. This framework provides essential features for test case management, automated execution, and result reporting, making it a valuable asset for web application testing.

## Features

- **Test Case Management:** Organize and manage test cases efficiently.
- **Automated Test Execution:** Execute test cases automatically to streamline testing workflows.
- **Result Reporting:** Generate detailed reports for better analysis and debugging.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python and pip installed on your machine.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/spheleleMakau/automated_testign_framework.git
cd automated-testing-framework
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Run a Sample Test

Execute a sample test case to verify the setup:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_example.py
```

## Configuration

Configure the testing framework as needed. For example, specify the web browser for testing in the configuration.

## Usage

### Writing Test Cases

Write test cases using the framework. Here's an example:

```python
# tests/test_example.py
import unittest
from framework.web_driver import WebDriver

class TestExample(unittest.TestCase):
    def setUp(self):
        self.driver = WebDriver()

    def tearDown(self):
        self.driver.close()

    def test_google_search(self):
        self.driver.get("https://www.google.com")
        self.assertIn("Google", self.driver.driver.title)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    unittest.main()
```

### Running Tests

Execute test suites and individual tests:

```bash
python -m unittest tests/test_example.py
```

## Reporting

Test results are reported in the console. Additionally, a result file (`test_results_timestamp.txt`) is created with detailed test results.
